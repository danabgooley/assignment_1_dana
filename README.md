# about-me

This is an about me page for Dana Gooley. It has a few samples of work and basic information and a couple of bad jokes.

I have a couple of questions.

1: I would really like to get the business/organization and date in the resume section to be on the same line, but with different styling and spacing... just to get them on the same line would be great! I tried to create some columns using either html or css, but both seemed relatively complicated. So, when you look at the website, the organization is left-aligned and the date is center-aligned, but on different lines, so it looks a little weird. 

2: Is there a way to get the border to fill/stretch to the edges of the browser? right now there's some weird white space that I can't get rid of.

3: last thing! How can i make a side nav bar with a photo in it? is that wicked advanced? my ideal was to get the circular photo at the top of a nav bar with the portfolio link underneath it. 

Portfolio question: can i put captions under photos in an unordered list? I wanted them to be side by side, rather than vertical, but I couldn't figure that out. 

Thank you for checking it out!!
