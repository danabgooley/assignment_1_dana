		<h3>WHERE I COME FROM</h3>

						
		<p>I graduated from American University with a degree in journalism and a job lined up as an overnight editor at a news radio station in Washington, D.C. After a year of nocturnal life, I moved to Boston for a year of service as an AmeriCorps VISTA at Citizen Schools, an education nonprofit. I'm one half of our two-person marketing team. We manage the needs of six regional offices and the organization headquarters. Never a dull moment.</p>
